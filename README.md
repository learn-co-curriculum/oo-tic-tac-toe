# OO Tic Tac Toe

## Objectives

1. Build a CLI Tic Tac Toe game!
2. Encapsulate Tic Tac Toe in a `TicTacToe` object.

## Overview

You're going to be building a 2 player CLI version of Tic Tac Toe by building a `TicTacToe` object. The game play will be very similar to other versions of TicTacToe.

## Instructions

**Run `bundle` within this lab's directory before getting started.**

```

#### Gemfile and Rakefile

These files set up some tools and gems for our project and can mostly be ignored. Make sure to run `bundle` before starting this project so that you have all the required gems.

#### `bin/tictactoe`

This is our main executable and will be how we run our game.

#### `lib/tic_tac_toe.rb`

Our main `TicTacToe` class will be defined here with all the data and logic required to play a game of tic tac toe via instances of `TicTacToe`.

#### `spec`

There are three test files that should be completed in order. `01_tic_tac_toe_spec.rb` sets tests for our helper methods within `TicTacToe`. `02_play_spec.rb` tests the main `#play` method. `03_cli_spec.rb` tests the CLI.

### Your Object Oriented Tic Tac Toe

We're going to be building a very well encapsulated object for Tic Tac Toe where each instance method will represent a discrete, single responsibility or functionality of a Tic Tac Toe game.

We'll be following the Tic Tac Toe conventions of representing the board as an array with 9 elements where `" "` represents an empty cell in the board.

We'll be getting user input via `gets` and a player will choose a position by entering 1-9. Our program will then fill out the appropriate position on the board with the player's token.

We will keep track of which player's turn it is and how many turns have been played. We will check to see, at every turn, if there is a winner. If there is a winner, we'll congratulate them. If there is a tie, we will inform our players.

## Instructions

### `TicTacToe` class.

Open up `lib/tic_tac_toe.rb`. You'll be defining the main game class, `TicTacToe` in `lib/tic_tac_toe.rb`. Without that file defining a `TicTacToe` class, everything will break.

Every method you build will be encapsulated by this class.

### `#initialize` and `@board`

The first test in `01_tic_tac_toe_spec.rb` will ensure the requirement that when a new game of Tic Tac Toe is started — that is, when a new instance of `TicTacToe` is initialized — the instance of the game must set the starting state of the board, an array with 9 `" "` empty strings, within an instance variable named `@board`.

In other words, your `#initialize` method should set a `@board` variable equal to a new, empty array that represents the game board.

#### `WIN_COMBINATIONS`

Define a `WIN_COMBINATIONS` constant within the `TicTacToe` class, and set it equal to a nested array filled with the index values for the various winning combinations possible in Tic Tac Toe.

**Top-Tip:** When you see this line, `TicTacToe::WIN_COMBINATIONS`, in the test suite, that means the test suite is accessing the constant `WIN_COMBINATIONS` that was declared inside the `TicTacToe` class.

```ruby
# within the body of TicTacToe

WIN_COMBINATIONS = [
  [0,1,2], # Top row
  [3,4,5]  # Middle row
  # et cetera, creating a nested array for each win combination
]

# the rest of the TicTacToe class definition
```
**Tip:** The next bunch of methods we will be describing have already been defined in previous labs. You can copy your code from those labs, paste them in this one, and tweak them slightly to work with the object oriented approach to pass the tests.

#### `#display_board`

Define a method that prints the current board representation based on the `@board` instance variable.

#### `#input_to_index`

Define a method into which we can pass user input (in the form of a string, e.g., `"1"`, `"5"`, etc.) and have it return to us the corresponding index of the `@board` array. Remember that, from the player's point of view, the board contains spaces 1-9. But the indices in an array start their count at 0. If the user inputs `5`, your method must correctly translate that from the player's perspective to the array's — accounting for the fact that `@board[5]` is *not* where the user intended to place their token.

#### `#move`

Your `#move` method must take in two arguments: the index in the `@board` array that the player chooses and the player's token (either `"X"` or `"O"`). The second argument, the player's token, should default to `"X"`.

#### `#position_taken?`

The `#position_taken?` method will be responsible for evaluating the user's desired move against the Tic Tac Toe board and checking to see whether or not that position is already occupied. Note that this method will be running *after* `#input_to_index`, so it will be checking index values. When it is passed the index value for a prospective move, `#position_taken?` will check to see if that position on the `@board` is vacant or if it contains an `"X"` or an `"O"`. If the position is free, the method should return `false` (i.e., "the position is not taken"); otherwise, it will return `true`.

#### `#valid_move?`

Build a method `valid_move?` that accepts a position to check and returns `true` if the move is valid and `false` or `nil` if not. A valid move means that the submitted position is:

1. Present on the game board.
2. Not already filled with a token.

#### `#turn`

Build a method `#turn` to encapsulate the logic of a single complete turn composed of the following routine:

1. Ask the user for their move by specifying a position between 1-9.
2. Receive the user's input.
3. Translate that input into an index value.
4. If the move is valid, make the move and display the board.
5. If the move is invalid, ask for a new move until a valid move is received.

All these procedures will be wrapped into our `#turn` method. However, the majority of the logic for these procedures will be defined and encapsulated in individual methods that you've already built.

You can imagine the pseudocode for the `#turn` method:

```
ask for input
get input
translate input into index
if index is valid
  make the move for index
  show the board
else
  ask for input again
end
```

#### `#turn_count`

This method returns the number of turns that have been played based on the `@board` variable.

#### `#current_player`

The `#current_player` method should use the `#turn_count` method to determine if it is `"X"`'s or `"O"`'s turn.

#### `#won?`

Your `#won?` method should return false/nil if there is no win combination present in the board and return the winning combination indexes as an array if there is a win. Use your `WIN_COMBINATIONS` constant in this method. Please note that this is the first time you'll need to return a winning combo. Previous tests only required `#won?` to be truthy.

#### `#full?`

The `#full?` method should return true if every element in the board contains either an "X" or an "O".

#### `#draw?`

Build a method `#draw?` that returns `true` if the board is full and has not been won, `false` if the board is won, and `false` if the board is neither won nor full.

#### `#over?`

Build a method `#over?` that returns true if the board has been won or is full (i.e., is a draw).

#### `#winner`

Given a winning `@board`, the `#winner` method should return the token, `"X"` or `"O"`, that has won the game.

### Putting it all together: the `#play` method

#### `#play`

The play method is the main method of the Tic Tac Toe application and is responsible for the game loop. A Tic Tac Toe game must allow players to take turns, checking if the game is over after every turn. At the conclusion of the game, whether because it was won or ended in a draw, the game should report to the user the outcome of the game. You can imagine the pseudocode:

```
until the game is over
  take turns
end

if the game was won
  congratulate the winner
else if the game was a draw
  tell the players it ended in a draw
end
```

Run the tests for the `#play` method by typing `rspec spec/02_play_spec.rb` in your terminal.

### The CLI: `bin/tictactoe`

Your `bin/tictactoe` CLI should:

1. Instantiate an instance of `TicTacToe`
2. Start the game by calling `#play` on that instance.
